# Using a distance-based approach, VillÃ©ger et al. (2008) proposed to distinguish three
# independent components in the functional diversity of a given community: functional
# richness (FRic) represents the amount of functional space filled by a community,
# i.e. the volume of the minimum convex hull that includes all species present in
# the multidimensional space of functional traits; functional evenness (FEve) measures
# the regularity of the abundance distribution of the species along the minimum
# spanning tree that links the species points in multidimensional functional space;
# functional divergence (FDiv) relates to how species abundances are distributed
# within the functional trait space. FEve and FDiv are constrained between 0 and
