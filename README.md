# Intermeeting_AIL
Hi! This is the repository of the Intermeeting course fo the Aassociation of Iberian Limnologists organized by the J-AIL. I happen to be one of the trainers of the course and have prepared this small repository to upload and work with all the information, slides and everything else! 

We will be working of different sessions in Granda between 24th and 26th of October. It will be a nice experience and we will be very happy to be together!
